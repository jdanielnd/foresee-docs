<p>Foresee is an extremely simple and easy to use app.</p>

<section>
<h4>First Steps</h4>

<p>As you can see in the <a href="articles/first-steps.html">First steps</a> section, in order to create forecasts, you only need to load a data file with the history of the series that you wish to project.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Formatting a data file</h4>

<p>The only thing you need to be careful about is that the file be correctly formatted. Therefore, we recommend that you read carefully the <a href="#">How to format a data file</a> section.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Understanding the forecasts</h4>

<p>Although you don't need to be an "expert" in statistics to use the app - the concept behind Foresee is exactly that! - it is important that you know how to interpret a forecast. The <a href="#">How to understand forecasts</a> section summarizes in a very didactic way all you need to know how to use safely Foresee forecasts.</p>
