<p>The forecasts you generate with Foresee are filed into projects, which you can access at any time from your desktop, tablet or smartphone.</p>

<p>Moreover, Foresee allows you to export the results of your forecasts into CSV files, which can be opened in Microsoft Excel Â®. If you prefer, results can also be converted into PDF reports that contain plots and tables of your forecasts.</p>

<p>To access the forecasts stored within a project, click on the name of the project you want to view.</p>
