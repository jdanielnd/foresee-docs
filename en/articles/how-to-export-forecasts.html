<p>The forecasts you generate with Foresee are filed into projects, which you can access at any time, either from your desktop, tablet or smartphone.</p>

<p>Beyond that, Foresee allows you to export the results of your forecasts into CSV files - which can be opened in Microsoft Excel Â® - or, if you prefer, into PDF reports which contain plots and tables of your forecasts.</p>

<p>To access the forecasts stored within a project, click on the name of the particular project.</p>
