<h4>Goals x Forecasts in Sales</h4>

<p>It is common for companies to use sales estimates compiled by their vendors in their decision-making processes, or even to consider the goals set by the company themselves as the sales estimate.</p>

<p>These estimates, although easier to obtain, usually present a problem: they are not impartial enough.</p>

<p>Sales estimates generally show a conservative bias, while the goals set by the company are usually characterized by a more motivational bias. Therefore, larger companies use statistical projections in their decision-making processes, because these are objective and unbiased.</p>

<h4>What is "most likely"?</h4>

<p>Constructed from probability methods, statistical projections indicate the most likely scenario for sales within a particular period. This allows for a clear separation between what is a goal and what is a projection.</p>

<h4>Statistical projections reduce estimation errors</h4>

<p>Goals and forecasts are fundamental to the management of any company. But it is important to know when to use one or the other.</p>

<p>For making decisions, it is important to consider the more likely scenario as a sales forecast. And that is exactly what statistical projections provide.</p>

<p>By using statistical projections, the company reduces its estimation errors, which consistently improves the quality of their decisions, and therefore their results.</p>
