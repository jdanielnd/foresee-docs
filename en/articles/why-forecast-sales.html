<p>Different scenarios require different decisions.</p>

<p>Many companies make daily decisions that rely upon sales forecasts, for example:</p>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>They establish goals for their sales teams.</li>
  <li>They put together promotions.</li>
  <li>They discount products.</li>
  <li>They calculate appropriate warehouse stock levels.</li>
  <li>They decide how much to buy.</li>
  <li>They lay down volume productions.</li>
  <li>They plan purchases of machinery and equipment.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The quality of a company’s decisions will depend upon the quality of their sales forecasts.</p>

  <p>Any one of the decisions mentioned above requires some type of calculation of sales. The quality of the decisions that are made will to a great extent depend upon the quality of the forecasts that they are based upon.</p>

<p><strong>The better a company can foresee their sales, the better they can plan and the more direct their decisions will be. It is that simple!</strong></p>

<p>For example, when a company decides to target a 10% growth in sales over the last year, they are defining “desired growth”.</p>

<p>It is important that they can compare this goal, or “desired growth”, with “projected growth”.</p>

<p>If the projections indicate a growth of 20%, a goal of 10% will probably be undersized. To the contrary if the projections point to a 5% reduction in sales, the company will know before hand that they will need to take action in their sales efforts in order to cover this gap. They could increase their sales framework, incorporate new distribution channels, increase the amount spent in advertising or they could even decide to extend their product portfolio. All of these options need effective planning and time to put into practice.</p>
