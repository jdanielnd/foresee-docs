<p>The forecasts generated by the same data file are stored inside a <strong>project</strong>, which makes further access to the results easier. You can keep as many projects as you want in your account!</p>

<p>To create a project, click on <strong>New project</strong>.</p>

    <li>select, in your computer, the data file with the series history that you would like to project.</li>
    <li>chose the prediction range.</li>
    <li>click on “Create Project”.</li>
  </ol>

<p><strong>You're ready!</strong> In a few moments you will be automatically redirected to the project page, which you just created (see image below).</p>
