<p>To generate forecasts, you must first load the historical data of the series that you wish to forecast. This loading is made using a <strong>CSV data file</strong>.</p>

<p>This CSV file can easily be created from a Microsoft Excel ® spreadsheet. Once the dates and values ​​of the series are correctly entered on this worksheet, simply click (while in Excel) on <strong>File > Save as ... ></strong>, then select the <strong>CSV</strong> option on <strong>Type</strong>.</p>

<p>After loading the data file in Foresee, the whole process is automated, and the forecasts are generated in approximately one minute.</p>

<p>However, it is important to pay attention to the formatting guidelines listed below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>File Structure</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>The first line should contain the header with the title of the columns arranged below it.</li>
      <li>The first column should contain the dates of series.</li>
      <li>The following columns (column 2 onwards) should contain the values ​​of the series (see illustration below).</li>
      <div class="img-box">
        <img src="images/format/fig1.png"/>
      </div>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Formatting of first line or header</strong></p>
    <p>The formatting of column headings is quite flexible.</p>
    <p>You can use upper or lowercase letters, as well as numbers, spaces, periods, hyphens and subscripts.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that it is not possible to create two or more series with the same name within the same data file.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Formatting the historical data</strong></p>

    <p>The data can represent:</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><strong>Monetary values​​</strong>: for example, the value of the monthly sales;</li>
        <li><strong>Quantities</strong>: monthly units sold for item "x";</li>
        <li><strong>Percentage</strong>: monthly contribution margin.</li>
      </ol>

    <p>In all these cases the series:</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Must contain only numeric values​​,</li>
        <li>May contain point or comma as decimal separator,</li>
        <li>Cannot contain any thousands separator,</li>
        <li>Cannot contain any symbols such as £, US$, %, etc.</li>
      </ol>

    <p>When expressing percentages, the data must be represented as decimal numbers (for example, as 0.134 or 0.625, and not 13.4% or 62.5%).</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Formatting dates in the CSV data file</strong></p>

    <p>Dates should always include a <strong>day</strong>, a <strong>month</strong> and a <strong>year</strong>. Foresee recognizes four different date formats.</p>

    <p>For example, to represent June 30, 2010, you can use any one of the following formats:</p>

    <div class="img-box">
      <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
        <thead>
          <th>Format</th>
          <th>Date</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>DD/MM/YYYY</td>
            <td>30/06/2010</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>MM/DD/YYYY</td>
            <td>06/30/2010</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>DD/MM/YY</td>
            <td>30/06/10</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>MM/DD/YY</td>
            <td>06/30/10</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Formatting dates in Foresee</strong></p>

    <p>For dates reported in the data file to be interpreted correctly, it is necessary to let Foresee know the date format you'll be working with before loading the file.</p>

    <p>By clicking <strong>Settings > Date format</strong> (see picture below), you can select the format with which you wish to work.</p>

    <div class="img-box">
      <img src="images/format/fig2.png"/>
    </div>

    <p>This date configuration is saved in your profile. You only need to repeat this procedure if you want to load a data file with a new date format.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Series frequency</strong>

    <p>Foresee allows you to work with monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual data.</p>

    <p>To represent any of these periods (month, quarter, semester, or year), you can refer (a) to the beginning of the period or (b) to the end of the period.</p>

    <p>Foresee will work both ways. You can use either of these two criteria, as long as it is maintained consistently throughout the series.</p>

    <p>The table below shows the two options available for representing months, quarters, semesters or years.</p>

    <div class="img-box">
      <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
        <thead>
          <th>Frequency</th>
          <th>Periods</th>
          <th>Option 1<br>
            <small>Reference to the beginning of the period</small></th>
          <th>Option 2<br>
            <small>Reference to the end of the period</small></th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Monthly</td>
            <td>January, February e March of 2013</td>
            <td>01/01/2013<br>
              02/01/2013<br>
              03/01/2013</td>
            <td>01/31/2013<br>
              02/28/2013<br>
              03/31/2013</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Quarterly</td>
            <td>1st, 2nd e 3rd quarters of 2013</td>
            <td>01/01/2013<br>
              04/01/2013<br>

            <td>03/31/2013<br>
              06/30/2013<br>
              09/30/2013
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Semi-annual</td>
            <td>1st e 2nd half of 2013 and 1st half of 2014</td>
            <td>01/01/2013<br>
              07/01/2013<br>

            <td>06/30/2013<br>
              12/31/2013<br>
              06/30/2014</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Yearly</td>
            <td>2013, 2014 and 2015</td>
            <td>01/01/2013<br>
              01/01/2014<br>

            <td>12/31/2013<br>
              12/31/2014<br>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>As indicated in the table above, in order to represent, for example, the months of January, February and March of 2013, you can use 01/01/2013, 02/01/2013 and 03/01/2013, referring to the beginning of these periods.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, you can also express these months by referring to the end of the period (i.e., 01/31/2013, 02/28/2013 and 03/31/2013).</p>

    <p>Both of these forms for representing time will work with Foresee. In both cases, it will understand that you are referring to the months of January, February and March, whether the reference is made to the beginning or end of the period, as long as the criterion adopted is consistent throughout the series.</p>

    <p>Similarly, to refer to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2013, you may refer to the beginning of the quarters (01/01/2013, 04/01/2013 and 07/01/2013) or if you prefer, you can refer to the end of the quarter (03/31/2013, 06/30/2013 and 09/30/2013).</p>

    <p>In both cases, Foresee will understand that you are referring to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2013.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Tip:</strong> If you always choose to work with the starting point of the period, you won't have to ask yourself, "What was the last day of each period" (28, 29, 30 or 31?). You will always use the 1st day of the month when dealing with monthly data or the 1st day of the starting month of each period when dealing with quarterly, semi-annual, or annual data.</div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Minimum and maximum size of the series</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p><strong>Minimum number of periods</strong></p>

        <p>To be able to forecast the values ​​of a series, Foresee needs to access the values of at least 5 consecutive previous periods from this series (five months, five quarters, five semesters or five years, for monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual data, respectively).</p>

        <p>However, it is important to remember that the longer the historical data, the better the forecasts will be.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Seasonality and minimum number of periods</strong></p>

        <p>To be able to detect the seasonality of a series, Foresee needs to have access to at least 2 full years of information (24 months, 8 quarters, etc.).</p>

        <p>This does not mean that you cannot generate forecasts with less than 24 months or fewer than 8 quarters. If the series to be forecasted do not show seasonality, this will have no major effect on the quality of the forecasts.</p>

        <p>However, if the series you are forecasting show an important seasonal pattern, it will not be represented in the forecasts, which means larger prediction errors.</p>

        <p>This does not apply to annual data, since these do not exhibit seasonality.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Maximum number of periods</strong></p>

        <p>Foresee allows you to load data files with series composed of up to 120 periods (120 months, 120 quarters, etc..).</p>

        <p>However, this does not mean that you have to work with such a large number of periods in order to generate good quality forecasts.</p>

        <p>If your data are monthly, for example, you can generate good quality forecasts by working with a history of 48 or even 24 months.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that the quality of the forecasts will improve as you increase the number of periods.</p>
      </li>
    </ol> 
    <li>
      <p><strong>Maximum number of series in a single data file</strong></p>

      <p>Foresee allows you to load data files containing up to 20 different series each time.</p>

      <p>The forecasts for these series are computed simultaneously, and they will be saved within the same project on Foresee.<p>

      <p>This does not mean that you are limited to 20 forecasts. In fact, you can generate as many forecasts as you wish, but each data file (and consequently, each project) may not contain more than 20 different series.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The series that comprise a single data file must have the same frequency and must occur at the same time.</strong></p>

    <p>The different series in a data file share a single column of dates. This means that these series:</p>
    <ol type="a">  
      <li>Should have the same frequency, be it monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly.</li>
      <li>Should begin and end on the same dates.</li>
      <li>Should have the same length.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>"Missing" data ​​and "zero" values</strong></p>

    <p>Missing values occur when no data value is available for this series in the current observation. This happens, for example, when a company does not store the number of units sold for a specific itemin a given month.</p>

    <p>In such case, Foresee cannot generate a forecast because there is a "missing value" or "gap" in the historical data. The series must be complete, with no "missing" values ​​or periods.</p>

    <p>Note that this is different from a value equal to "zero".</p>

    <p>This happens, for example, when a product's sale have been zero (i.e., the company did not sell any units of that product).</p>

    <p>This value should be reported in the data file as "0" (number zero) and not as a blank field or "missing value", which are not allowed in Foresee.</p>
  </li>
